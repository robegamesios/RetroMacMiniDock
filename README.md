DIY M4 Mac Mini Retro Dock

I built a DIY retro Mac mini dock with a built-in screen, inspired by Wokyis, but cheaper and more customizable.

The dock is 3D printed and designed in Tinkercad, using a simple two-part design: a base that sits on the Mac mini and a top section that holds a 7-inch display.

Inside, I hide an OWC 1M2 Thunderbolt enclosure with a 2TB NVMe drive, delivering up to 40Gbps Thunderbolt speeds, plus a USB-C hub for clean cable management.
